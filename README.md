## 📘 Project Overview

The **Airbnb Clone** backend is designed to allow users to:

* Create and manage user accounts.
* List and manage properties.
* Search for and book properties.
* Process secure payments.
* Handle authentication and authorization.
* Store and manage booking history.
* Provide APIs for frontend integration.

This documentation is divided into five major tasks:

## 🎭 Use Case Diagram

The **Use Case Diagram** provides a visual overview of user-system interactions:

**Actors:**

* **Guest**: Can browse, book, and review properties.
* **Host**: Can list and manage properties.
* **Admin**: Oversees and manages platform data.

📌 **Diagram:** See [`use-case-diagram/`](./use-case-diagram/).

## 📝 User Stories

The following **user stories** define core interactions:

1. As a **user**, I want to **register an account** so that I can book properties.
2. As a **host**, I want to **list properties with details and images** so that guests can find them.
3. As a **guest**, I want to **search for properties by date, location, and price** so that I can find the best options.
4. As a **guest**, I want to **make a secure payment** so that I can confirm my booking.
5. As an **admin**, I want to **manage users and property listings** to ensure platform integrity.

📌 See [`user-stories/user-stories.md`](./user-stories/user-stories.md).
